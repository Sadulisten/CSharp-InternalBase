## CSharp - Internal Base

A basic clean template for somewhat easily executing your managed C# inside an unmanaged process.

A compatible injector along with an appropriate settings file for said injector has been provided in the *\bin\Debug* folder.

Make sure to clone this repository and restore nuget packages as the functionality of this depends on them.
